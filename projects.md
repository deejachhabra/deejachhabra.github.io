<a target="_blank" class="folder-link" href="https://github.com/deejachhabra/DFW_TempChangeYearly/tree/main"><b>Forecast Monthly Average Temperature in DFW | TensorFlow, Python, NumPy, Pandas</b></a><br>
● Employed ARIMA and FBProphet machine learning model for accurate temperature forecasting.<br>
● Developed informative data visualizations using Power BI to illustrate historical trends and predict temperature.<br>
● Achieved significant accuracy with monthly average temperatures projected at 85.74 (ARIMA), 90.61(FbProphet)<br>

<a target="_blank" class="folder-link" href="https://github.com/deejachhabra/PriceOptimization"><b>Price Estimation with RFC and XGBoost | TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib</b></a><br>
● Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost Regressor for fare estimation, achieving an impressive 0.85 R2 score. <br>
● Transformed categorical features into numerical using label encoding, leading to 25% reduction in training time.<br>
● Leveraged exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, leading to a change in feature dimensionality.<br>

<a target="_blank" class="folder-link" href="https://github.com/deejachhabra/Kaggle"><b>Early Detection of 3D printing issues | scikit-learn, pytorch, computer vision, SciPy</b></a><br>
● Employed data augmentation on images an visually inspected the results by plotting them to validate.<br>
● Utilized multiple CNN models, tuning them, and leveraging transfer learning with models such as VGG16 to exploit the 
  dataset's scale and achieve notable performance with a success rate of 99% in anomaly detection.<br>
● Extensive research on ML, DL to apply image segmentation to improve model accuracy by at least 10%.<br>
